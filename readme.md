# **Graffiti Wall Social App**

**Description**
The graffiti wall is a shared space where users can paint and paste images onto any of 16 grids. Like a real graffiti wall, you can paint over other people's work. Unlike a real graffiti wall, this one keeps a public log of who contributes to it. 

It also includes a mode to view who pasted which image onto the wall by hovering your mouse over the image.

A suite of painting tools are provided. 
Users can upload images or search IMGUR for images to upload. You can also apply image filters and effects to the pictures!

As a community site, creativity is encouraged but also user accountability. If you post something obscene or are a jerk, people will can see who did it.
